### Project Name: Robots for Hire

### Objectives
* A web application that provides customers with an array of different manual labor service options through autonomous robots.
* Displays all robots in every industry and every level, from small and simple cleaning robots to big and complex manufacturing robots. 
* A platform that displays and recommends different robots that are suitable for different jobs as well as various statistics that represent the robot's capabilities so that customers can easily choose the best robot for them.

### Scope and Limitations
* The current iteration of the app will only focus on the manufacturer side, therefore registered users are all manufacturers.
* Creation of users will only be done in the backend.
* Only manufacturers can create a robot.
* Only the manufacturers of certain robots are allowed to view, update and delete said robot.
* Unregistered users can view all the manufactured robots listed by all manufacturers.
